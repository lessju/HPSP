The Maltese Islands lie at almost the exact geographical heart of the Mediterranean Sea. With Sicily some 95 kms to the North, Tripoli 350 kms to the South and Tunis 320 kms to the West, Malta is virtually at the crossroads between continents. The islands' strategic position has, in fact, made them subject to a succession of rulers, including the Phoenicians, Romans, Moorish, Normans, Aragonese, Knights of St. John, French and Britsh, who in turn left their influence on the country and language as we know them today. Malta's pre-history dates back to 5000 B.C., whilst its documented past is traceable over a period of 2000 years. Malta gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1964, became a republic in 1974 and joined the European Union in 2004.

The national language is Maltese which is a complex derivative of semitic and romantic languages using a primarily Latin alphabet but also including a number of additional letters which originate in the Arab language. English is also an official language. The climate is typically Mediterranean, having mild winters and hot summers. Malta has a population of 400,000 and is visited annually by over a million tourists.
