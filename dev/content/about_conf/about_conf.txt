Signal processing lies at the core of large-scale physics instruments, from correlating tens of thousands of antennas in the upcoming Square Kilometer Array to beam diagnostics in the Large Hadron Collider. These instruments pose similar challenges in addressing large data rates and processing requirements, with algorithms implemented on a wide variety of architectures, including FPGA, GPU and multi-core systems. The main aim of this conference is to bring together leading experts from academia and industry, specialising in different fields, where experiences and solutions can be shared and improved. The conference will be split into XXX major research areas:

- Radio Astronomy and the Square Kilometer Array
- Particle Physics and the Large Hadron Collider
- 
- 

To do: Insert subfield and chair person for each field
