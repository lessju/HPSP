Signal processing lies at the core of large-scale physics instruments, from correlating tens of thousands of antennas in the upcoming Square Kilometer Array to beam diagnostics in the Large Hadron Collider. These instruments pose similar challenges in addressing large data rates and processing requirements, with algorithms implemented on a wide variety of architectures, including FPGA, GPU and multi-core systems. The main aim of this conference is to bring together leading experts from academia and industry, specialising in different fields, where experiences and solutions can be shared and improved. 

Large scale instruments which will be discussed in this conference include: The Low Frequency Array; the Square Kilometer Array; the Cherenkov Telescope Array; the Large Hadron Collider (including ATLAS and CMS experiments) and the European X-Ray Free Electron Laser. The conference is split into five major research areas:

- Time Domain Processing
- Processing Pipelines
- Data Acquisition
- Filtering
- Imaging
