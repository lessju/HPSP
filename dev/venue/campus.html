There are a further nearly 3,500 pre-tertiary students at the Junior College which is also managed by the University.

						Villa Bighi, Kalkara
					</div>
					<div class ='sub-info'>
						<p>
							The Bighi Royal Naval Hospital, as it used to be known, situated in Kalkara is one of Malta's finest examples of neo-classical architecture from the early 19th century. The hospital served the eastern Mediterranean in the 19th and 20th centuries and contributed to the nursing and medical care of casualties whenever hostilities occured in the Mediterranean, making Malta "the nurse of the Mediterranean". During the First World War it accommodated a very large number of casualties from the Daradanelles. During the Second World War, the Hospital was well within the target area of the heavy bombing since it was surrounded by military establishments. A number of its buildings were damaged or destroyed, including the x-ray theatre, the East and West Wings, the Villa and the Cot Lift from the Bighi Jetty to the Hospital.
						</p><br/>
						<p>
							In 1967, during the second rundown of the British services and their employees in Malta, Bighi Hospital was on the brink of closing down. On 17 September 1970 Bighi was closed down indefinitely. In 1977 parts of the building were occupied by the former Senglea Trade School while other sections accommodated a secondary school. Vila Bighi now houses the Malta Counsil for Science and Technology (MCST).
